# CONTRIBUTING

First, we create a fork of this repository. If you want to contribute to the Java version, make sure to uncheck the **Clone only the `main` branch** checkbox.

After that, make your changes to the repository you just cloned. To sync it with the main repository, you will see a button labeled "Sync Repo." Make sure that when syncing, you are syncing to the same branch as the main repository. For example:

```plaintext
I want to sync my `main` to the repository's `main`
```

Click `Sync` > select `Compare` from `your-fork-main` to `twcash01-main`. Always check this to prevent syncing the wrong branches.

After you have finished development and want to contribute, open a pull request to the `twcash01` repository. You will see an indicator saying this repository is ahead of the `twcash01` repository by {ammount} updates. That is when you should do a pull request. After that, wait for your pull request to be "merged" (accepted).

## CONTRIBUTING RULES
1. If you have anything concerning early game bridges, don't.
2. Just because you are contributing DOES NOT make you the author of the mod.
3. Sprites shall follow the current style of the mod.
4. I check your PRs, and I will know if you try something inappropriate.

Make sure to fix the grammar and code blocks.
