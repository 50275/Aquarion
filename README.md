# Aquarion
An Attempt to recreate Tantros, adding a whole new campaign with custom blocks, units, soundtrack, everything.

## Notes:
* This is incompatiable with foos client as it breaks the mod
* Remember to reinstall the mod once in a while so new content loads. Updates are often but mainly small.
* May or may not be good but I will try my best.
