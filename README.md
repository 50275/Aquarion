# Tantros-test
An Attempt to add tantros
must be on a BE build for weather to work. This is optional. (wwather is unfinished and wont be here for a while)
May or may not be good but I will try my best.
not compatiable with Foo's client, New Horizons, and possibly more

Since this is still testing there is a major bug I am currently working on.
It is simple but many will think that the campaign is locked, it is not.
Just go to the research menu and click on the map. Until then I am still working on it

Remember to reinstall the mod once in a while so new content loads. Updates are often but mainly small.
